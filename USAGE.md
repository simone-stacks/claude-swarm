# Usage

## Quick start

```bash
# Create a swarmfile and launch numbered agents.
SWARM_CONFIG=swarm.json ./launch.sh start --dashboard

# Later, after agents are running or have exited:
SWARM_CONFIG=swarm.json ./launch.sh wait
```

All configuration lives in the swarmfile (JSON).  Place a
`swarm.json` in your repo root or point to it with `SWARM_CONFIG`.

## Commands

```bash
./launch.sh start [--dashboard]   # Launch numbered agents.
./launch.sh stop                  # Stop all agents.
./launch.sh status                # Show containers.
./launch.sh logs N                # Tail agent N logs.
./launch.sh wait                  # Wait for already-started
                                  # numbered agents, then
                                  # post-process and harvest.
                                  # Does not start agents.
./launch.sh post-process          # Run only post-process, then
                                  # harvest.
./launch.sh interactive hunter    # Start a human-guided driver
                                  # session from agents[].name.
./launch.sh shell --agent hunter  # Start a shell in that profile.
```

## Environment variables

Credentials stay as env vars (not in shell history).

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | | API key (or use `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`). |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | | OAuth token via `claude setup-token`. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | | OpenAI API key (for Codex CLI driver). |
| `CODEX_AUTH_JSON` | `~/.codex/auth.json` | Path to Codex auth file (ChatGPT subscription). |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | | Google API key (for Gemini CLI driver). |
| `KIMI_API_KEY` | | Moonshot API key (for Kimi Code CLI driver). |
| `KIMI_CODE_HOME` | `~/.kimi-code` | Path to Kimi data dir (OAuth login state). |
| `QWEN_API_KEY` | | ModelStudio/DashScope API key (for Qwen Code CLI driver; `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` also accepted). |
| `QWEN_HOME` | `~/.qwen` | Path to Qwen home dir (login state and `settings.json`). |
| `SWARM_CONFIG` | | Path to swarmfile (or place `swarm.json` in repo root). |
| `SWARM_TITLE` | | Dashboard title override. |
| `SWARM_SKIP_DEP_CHECK` | | Set to `1` to silence dependency version warnings. |
| `SWARM_ACTIVITY_TIMEOUT` | `0` | Seconds of logfile silence before the in-container watchdog SIGTERMs the agent CLI's process group.  `0` disables.  See [Activity watchdog](#activity-watchdog). |
| `SWARM_ACTIVITY_POLL` | `10` | Watchdog mtime-poll interval, in seconds.  Rarely needs tuning. |
| `SWARM_WATCHDOG_GRACE` | `10` | Grace window between watchdog SIGTERM and SIGKILL.  Rarely needs tuning. |
| `SWARM_STOP_TIMEOUT` | `60` | Seconds `./launch.sh stop` passes to `docker stop -t`, so the harness's SIGTERM trap has time to ship any in-flight local commits via `_session_end_push` before SIGKILL hits.  See [Stopping the swarm](#stopping-the-swarm). |
| `CLAUDE_SWARM_RUNTIME_DIR` | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/claude-swarm/<project>` | Absolute owner-only (mode 0700) runtime override. Holds the bare repo, submodule mirrors, locks, and dashboard state. |

Per-group credentials (`api_key`, `auth_token`, `base_url`)
are set in the swarmfile.  Use `$VAR` references to pull
values from the host environment without hardcoding secrets.

## Config file fields

Per-group fields in `swarm.json` `agents` array:

| Field | Values | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `name` | string | Optional profile name for `interactive`, `chat`, and `shell`. |
| `model` | model name | Required. |
| `count` | integer | Numbered agents in this group (default: `0`). |
| `effort` | string | Reasoning depth (see below). |
| `context` | `full`, `slim`, `none` | How much of `.claude/` to keep (default: `full`). |
| `prompt` | file path | Per-group prompt override (default: top-level). |
| `auth` | `apikey`, `oauth`, `chatgpt`, omit | Which host credential to inject (see [Auth modes](#auth-modes)). |
| `api_key` | key or `$VAR` | Per-group API key for third-party endpoints. |
| `auth_token` | key or `$VAR` | Per-group Bearer token (OpenRouter-style). |
| `base_url` | URL | Per-group API endpoint. |
| `tag` | string or `$VAR` | Label for grouping runs (default: top-level). |
| `driver` | driver name | Agent driver override (default: top-level or `claude-code`). |

**Effort values** are driver-dependent:

- Claude Code: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `max` (Opus only).
- Codex CLI: `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`.
- Kimi Code CLI: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, but the set a
  model actually accepts is model-dependent — `kimi-for-coding` rejects
  `medium` and `xhigh` with a 400; use `low`, `high`, or `max` there.
- Qwen Code CLI: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` (written to
  `model.reasoningEffort`; on DashScope-backed qwen models any set tier
  currently collapses to `enable_thinking: true`).
- Gemini CLI: ignored.

Top-level fields: `prompt`, `setup`, `max_idle` (default: `3`),
`max_retry_wait`, `driver`, `inject_git_rules`,
`git_user` (`name`, `email`, `signing_key`),
`claude_code_version`, `codex_cli_version`, `kimi_cli_version`,
`qwen_cli_version`, `title`, `tag`, `pricing`, `docker_args`,
`post_process`.

### Interactive profiles

Use `interactive`, `chat`, or `shell` to open one human-guided
container from an `agents[]` profile:

```bash
SWARM_CONFIG=swarm.json ./launch.sh interactive hunter
SWARM_CONFIG=swarm.json ./launch.sh shell --agent hunter
SWARM_CONFIG=swarm.json ./launch.sh chat --agent-index 2
```

The profile supplies the same setup, Docker args, driver, model,
effort, auth, context, prompt, tag, and signing configuration used
for numbered agents. The container checks out a distinct branch:

```text
swarm/<run>/interactive-<profile>-<id>
```

Promptless profiles are allowed. They still need an explicit
`agents[]` entry; omitting `prompt` only means no prompt file is
injected before the native driver UI starts. Omit `count` or use
`count: 0` for a profile that should never launch as an
autonomous numbered agent:

```json
{
  "driver": "codex-cli",
  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "operator",
      "count": 0,
      "model": "gpt-5.4",
      "effort": "xhigh",
      "auth": "chatgpt",
      "context": "slim"
    }
  ]
}
```

Interactive containers do not affect numbered-agent idle
accounting and do not start post-processing. On exit, committed
work is pushed to the interactive branch. Uncommitted work stays
inside the container and is shown as dirty in the dashboard/status
view so it is not mistaken for harvested work.

### Retry on rate limits

Set `max_retry_wait` (seconds) to have agents retry with
exponential backoff when rate-limited instead of exiting:

```json
{ "max_retry_wait": 25200 }
```

Default is `0` (no retry -- exit immediately on fatal errors).
The backoff starts at 30 s, doubles each attempt, and caps at
30 min per sleep.  When the cumulative wait exceeds
`max_retry_wait`, the agent exits.  This also covers transient
network failures.

### Activity watchdog

Some CLIs (observed on `codex-cli`, occasionally `claude-code`)
can deadlock mid-request -- the process stays alive but stops
emitting output, so the harness's post-`wait` process-group
kill never fires and the container sits idle until an operator
notices and runs `docker stop`.  Setting
`SWARM_ACTIVITY_TIMEOUT` to a positive integer enables a
watchdog inside `_run_reaped` that polls the CLI's logfile
mtime; if the mtime doesn't advance for that many seconds the
watchdog SIGTERMs the CLI's process group, then SIGKILLs after
`SWARM_WATCHDOG_GRACE` seconds if the group hasn't exited.
Default is `0` (disabled); 300-600 is a sensible starting point
for production swarms:

```bash
SWARM_ACTIVITY_TIMEOUT=600 ./launch.sh start --dashboard
```

The watchdog's kill decision is written to the CLI's stderr
file (`/workspace/*.log.err` inside the container, visible via
`docker logs`) so an operator investigating an agent that
exited early can tell a watchdog-killed exit from a
crashed-on-its-own exit.  `SWARM_ACTIVITY_POLL` (default 10 s)
tunes how often the watchdog checks mtime;
`SWARM_WATCHDOG_GRACE` (default 10 s) tunes the SIGTERM→SIGKILL
gap.  Both rarely need adjustment outside the test suite.

### Stopping the swarm

`./launch.sh stop` sends each numbered agent and post-process
container `docker stop -t 60`.  The 60 s grace gives the
harness's SIGTERM trap time to ship
any in-flight local commits (in-place rebase → scratch
worktree → `agent-parked/*` salvage) before docker forces
SIGKILL.  Without this window, commits the agent made during
the session it was interrupted in stayed in
`/workspace/.git` and died with the container; the
session-end push pipeline only runs at the bottom of each
loop iteration and never gets to run on a mid-session
SIGTERM.

For larger swarms where 45+ agents race the same push lock,
raise the grace:

```bash
SWARM_STOP_TIMEOUT=120 ./launch.sh stop
```

The harness handles SIGTERM and SIGINT identically; an
`Exited (143)` (`128+SIGTERM`) or `Exited (130)`
(`128+SIGINT`) status with a clean log line of
`emergency shutdown complete` indicates the trap fired and
the emergency push attempt completed.

### Extra Docker arguments

Pass arbitrary flags to every `docker run` invocation via the
top-level `docker_args` array.  Each element is one shell token:

```json
{
  "docker_args": [
    "-v", "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock",
    "--privileged"
  ]
}
```

This is useful for mounting the host Docker socket, adding
devices or capabilities, setting network modes, or passing any
other flags that the harness does not manage natively.

Docker's `-e` flag accepts two forms: `-e VAR=value` passes a
literal value, and `-e VAR` (no `=value`) inherits `VAR` from the
caller's environment at `launch.sh start` time, omitting it
entirely when unset.  This lets you parameterize a single
swarmfile with host env without templating:

```json
{
  "setup": "scripts/setup.sh",
  "docker_args": ["-e", "TARGET_REPO", "-e", "TARGET_REV"]
}
```

```bash
TARGET_REPO=git@github.com:org/repo.git TARGET_REV=abc123 \
    ./launch.sh start
```

### Setup hook

The `setup` script runs once at container startup as root, via
`sudo -E bash <setup>`, so the full container environment crosses
the `sudo` boundary into the script.  Any variable passed through
`docker_args -e` (plus the swarm's own env like `AGENT_ID`,
`SWARM_MODEL`, `MAX_IDLE`, ...) is visible inside `setup.sh`.
Default Debian sudoers would otherwise strip everything except
`PATH` via `env_reset`, so `-E` is what makes the example above
work end-to-end.

After `setup.sh` returns, the harness reclaims ownership of
`/workspace` so subsequent agent runs can modify the tree as the
non-root `agent` user.

### Commit signing

Set `git_user.signing_key` to an SSH private-key path on the
host to sign every commit agents and post-processors make.
Accepts a literal path, a bare `$VAR` reference (expanded from
the host environment), or a path starting with `~/` (expanded
to `$HOME` before mounting):

```json
{
  "git_user": {
    "name": "swarm-agent",
    "email": "agent@swarm.local",
    "signing_key": "~/.ssh/swarm-agent-signing"
  }
}
```

The key is bind-mounted read-only into each container at
`/etc/swarm/signing_key`.  The harness then copies it to
`/dev/shm/swarm-signing-key` with `0600` perms before
configuring git:

```
gpg.format      = ssh
user.signingkey = /dev/shm/swarm-signing-key
commit.gpgsign  = true
```

The copy step exists because `ssh-keygen -Y sign` refuses
world-readable keys with `UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE`, and
the bind mount inherits host perms (often `0644` for shared
swarm-bot keys).  `/dev/shm` is tmpfs, RAM-backed, and
per-container in Docker, so the private key bytes never hit
disk.  Without the copy, signing fails inside the container,
and Codex CLI silently retries with `--no-gpg-sign`
([openai/codex#6199](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/6199)),
landing commits without a signature.

When `signing_key` is absent -- or resolves to empty via an
unset `$VAR` -- signing is explicitly disabled inside the
container (`commit.gpgsign = false`), overriding anything that
might otherwise leak in from the image or a mounted config.

The host key file must exist at `launch.sh start` time;
otherwise launch fails with `ERROR: signing key not found`.
The container image ships `openssh-client` for the
`ssh-keygen -Y sign` that git invokes.

## Dashboard

```bash
./dashboard.sh
```

Per-agent model, auth source, status, cost, tokens, cache,
turns, throughput, and duration.  Updates every 3s.  The
header shows a compact model summary on a single line.
Interactive containers appear as `I1`, `I2`, etc. with their
branch and `dirty`, `unharvested`, or `harvested` state; they
do not count toward numbered-agent completion.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `q` | Quit. |
| `1`-`9` | Logs for agent N. |
| `P` | Post-process logs (the `P` row), if it exists. |
| `h` | Harvest results. |
| `s` | Stop numbered agents and post-process. |
| `p` | Start post-process after confirmation. |

The Model column appends the agent's reasoning effort as a
parenthesised letter: `(h)` high, `(m)` medium, `(l)` low,
`(x)` xhigh, `(n)` none, and `(M)` max. Models configured
without an `effort` show no suffix.

## Activity streaming

Agent activity streams to Docker logs in real time. Press
`[1-9]` in the dashboard (or `./launch.sh logs N`) to see
what an agent is doing:

```
12:34:56 harness[1] session start at=abc123
12:35:01   agent[1] Read src/main.ts
12:35:03   agent[1] Edit src/main.ts
12:35:08   agent[1] Shell: npm test
12:35:12   agent[1] Shell: git add -A && git commit -m "fix tests"
12:35:15   agent[1] Shell: git push origin agent-work
12:35:18 harness[1] session end cost=$0.12 in=800 out=644 turns=6 time=19s
```

The filter (`lib/activity-filter.sh`) parses stream-json
events from the agent CLI and prints one line per tool call
or thinking block.  The timestamp and agent ID are colored
in ANSI yellow (matching git's commit-hash color) for
readability.

Thinking/reasoning content appears as `Think: <summary>`
when the model produces it.  Whether thinking is emitted
depends on the model and configuration: Claude Code requires
extended thinking to be enabled, and Gemini CLI emits thought
events only for models that support them.

On Opus 4.7 and later the Anthropic API default for
`thinking.display` is `"omitted"`: the `thinking` field is
empty and the full reasoning is returned encrypted in the
`signature` field.  To restore summaries the client has to
explicitly send `thinking: {"display": "summarized"}` on
each Messages API request.

The claude-code driver writes `"showThinkingSummaries": true`
into the workspace's `.claude/settings.local.json` as a
forward-compatible opt-in.  As of Claude Code 2.1.111 the
CLI does not yet plumb that setting through to headless
(`-p --output-format stream-json`) requests for Opus 4.7, so
on today's releases this opt-in is effectively a no-op for
our pipeline.  The setting is retained so that a future
Claude Code release which wires it to the Messages API will
restore summaries automatically with no further swarm change.

While the client-side opt-in is missing, the activity filter
classifies the otherwise-blank blocks to keep the dashboard
informative:

- `Think: [encrypted]` — `thinking` empty, `signature` present.
  This is the expected Opus 4.7 `display:"omitted"` payload;
  the full reasoning exists server-side but is unavailable
  to the client.
- `Think: [empty]` — `thinking` empty and `signature` empty.
  Anomalous: neither summary nor encrypted reasoning; useful
  diagnostic that something upstream is off.

Blank `Think:` lines no longer reach the dashboard.  On
Opus 4.6 and earlier, summaries were the default and continue
to render as `Think: <summary>` unchanged.

## Testing

```bash
./tests/test.sh --help               # All options.
./tests/test.sh --unit               # Unit tests only.
./tests/test.sh                      # Single smoke test.
./tests/test.sh --all                # Full matrix.
./tests/test.sh --config swarm.json  # Custom config.
./tests/test.sh --no-inject          # Explicit git prompt.
./tests/test.sh --oauth              # OAuth-only smoke test.
```

Flags combine: `./tests/test.sh --config f.json --no-inject`.

The test harness uses its own built-in prompt (counting +
reasoning) regardless of config. The reasoning step exercises
adaptive thinking at different effort levels.

Unit tests (no Docker or API key):

```bash
./tests/test.sh --unit         # All unit tests.
./tests/test_activity_filter.sh  # Activity stream parsing.
./tests/test_config.sh         # Config parsing.
./tests/test_costs.sh          # Cost aggregation.
./tests/test_dashboard.sh      # Dashboard rendering.
./tests/test_drivers.sh        # Agent driver interface.
./tests/test_format.sh         # Formatting helpers.
./tests/test_harness.sh        # Stat extraction.
./tests/test_harvest.sh        # Harvest git ops.
./tests/test_launch.sh         # Launch logic.
```

## Post-processing

Add to `swarm.json`:

```json
{
  "post_process": {
    "prompt": "prompts/review.md",
    "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
    "effort": "low",
    "max_idle": 2
  }
}
```

Trigger via `[P]` in the dashboard, `./launch.sh post-process`,
or automatically via `./launch.sh wait` after numbered agents have
already been started. `./launch.sh wait` does not launch numbered
agents.

The post-process agent clones the same bare repo, sees all
commits on `agent-work`, runs its prompt, and pushes.

`harvest.sh` only merges agent work into the current local branch:
`agent-work` plus any `swarm/*/interactive-*` branches. It does
not run `post_process`. If you harvested manually and still need
post-processing, run `./launch.sh post-process`; use that command
directly when you intentionally want to run only the post-process
agent and then harvest.

Before merging, `harvest.sh` tags the current branch tip with a
local `swarm-harvest-<date>-<time>` tag (skipped on `--dry` and
when nothing is new). Undo a harvest with
`git reset --hard <tag>`. The tag is never pushed and does not
interfere with the harvested branches.

`post_process` also accepts `base_url`, `api_key`,
`auth_token`, `auth`, `tag`, `driver`, and `max_idle` -- same
fields as per-group agents -- to route post-processing through
a different provider or credential. `max_idle` controls how
many consecutive sessions with no commits before the
post-processor exits. When omitted it inherits the top-level
`max_idle` (default: `3`).

`post_process.setup` overrides the setup script for the
post-process pass: a path runs that script, `false` or `""`
skips setup (so a heavy top-level `setup` is not redone), and
omitting the key inherits the top-level `setup`.

`./launch.sh post-process` (and `wait` when it triggers
post-processing) exits with the post-process container's exit
code. Harvest still runs first, so a crashed agent's in-flight
commits are recovered locally, but a non-zero exit lets CI or
daemons refuse to publish partial state.

## Context modes

Motivated by [Evaluating AGENTS.md](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11988)
(Gloaguen et al.), which found that repository-level context files
can reduce agent success rates while increasing inference cost by
over 20%. This feature enables A/B comparisons within a single
swarm.

Control how much of `.claude/` each agent group sees:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `full` | Keep `.claude/` as-is (default). |
| `slim` | Keep only `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, strip agents/skills. |
| `none` | Remove entire `.claude/` directory (bare agent). |

Set per group in `swarm.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": [
    { "count": 2, "model": "claude-opus-4-6" },
    { "count": 1, "model": "claude-opus-4-6", "context": "none" }
  ]
}
```

Bare agents do exploratory work unconstrained by repo context
while other agents use skills and rules for structured output.
Non-default modes appear in the dashboard Ctx column and in
commit trailers (`> Ctx: bare`, `> Ctx: slim`).

## Per-group prompts

Each agent group can run a different prompt file:

```json
{
  "prompt": "tasks/hunt.md",
  "agents": [
    { "count": 2, "model": "claude-opus-4-6" },
    { "count": 1, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
      "prompt": "tasks/review.md" }
  ]
}
```

Groups without `prompt` inherit the top-level value.  When every
group specifies its own prompt, the top-level `prompt` can be
omitted entirely:

```json
{
  "agents": [
    { "count": 2, "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
      "prompt": "tasks/hunt.md" },
    { "count": 1, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
      "prompt": "tasks/review.md" }
  ]
}
```

Combined with context modes, this enables divergent exploration:
hunting agents run one prompt with full skills, a reconciliation
agent runs a different prompt to validate and normalize findings.

## Auth modes

Three credential mechanisms serve different purposes:

- **`auth`** — Controls which host credential is forwarded to
  the container.  Values: `apikey`, `oauth`, `chatgpt`, or
  omit (auto-detect).

- **`api_key`** — Per-group API key for third-party endpoints
  (MiniMax, etc.).  Passed as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` inside the
  container.  Supports `$VAR` references to host env vars.

- **`auth_token`** — Per-group Bearer token for endpoints
  that use `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` (OpenRouter-style).  Clears
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` so Claude Code enters third-party mode.
  Supports `$VAR` references.

### Claude Code

| `auth` value | Credential injected |
|---|---|
| `apikey` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` only |
| `oauth` | `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` only |
| omit | Both (CLI decides) |

For subscription auth (Pro/Max/Teams/Enterprise), generate
an OAuth token with `claude setup-token` and export
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`.

Claude Code credentials are resolved each time a container is
created. If you run `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... ./launch.sh start`,
that inline environment does not persist for a later
`./launch.sh shell --agent ...`; export the variable first or
prefix the `shell`, `chat`, or `interactive` command too. Inside a
Claude interactive shell, `claude auth status` should report the
injected credential.

### Codex CLI

| `auth` value | Credential injected |
|---|---|
| `apikey` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` only |
| `chatgpt` | Mounts `~/.codex/auth.json` (ChatGPT subscription) |
| omit | API key if set + auth.json if found |

For ChatGPT subscription auth (Plus/Pro/Team/Enterprise),
run `codex login` on the host to create `~/.codex/auth.json`,
then set `"auth": "chatgpt"` in your swarm config:

```json
{
  "driver": "codex-cli",
  "agents": [{ "model": "gpt-5.4", "auth": "chatgpt" }]
}
```

The auth file is bind-mounted read-only into containers.
Override the path with `CODEX_AUTH_JSON=/path/to/auth.json`.

### Kimi Code CLI

| `auth` value | Credential injected |
|---|---|
| `apikey` | `KIMI_API_KEY` via the `KIMI_MODEL_*` env provider |
| `oauth` | Mounts `~/.kimi-code` (after `kimi login` on the host) |
| omit | API key if set + data dir if found |

The CLI does not read `KIMI_API_KEY` from the shell environment.
The driver forwards it as `KIMI_MODEL_API_KEY` instead, which makes
the CLI synthesize an in-memory provider for the configured model.
With `apikey` auth the swarmfile `model` is used as the API model
id (the part after `/` in aliases like `kimi-code/kimi-for-coding`),
not looked up as a config alias.

For OAuth auth, run `kimi login` on the host, then set
`"auth": "oauth"` in your swarm config:

```json
{
  "driver": "kimi-cli",
  "agents": [{ "model": "kimi-code/kimi-for-coding", "auth": "oauth" }]
}
```

The data dir is bind-mounted read-only; each container copies it to
a writable location on startup.  Override the source path with
`KIMI_CODE_HOME=/path/to/kimi-home`.

### Qwen Code CLI

| `auth` value | Credential injected |
|---|---|
| `apikey` | `QWEN_API_KEY`/`DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` forwarded as `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` |
| `oauth` | Mounts `~/.qwen` (after `qwen` + `/auth` or `bl config agent` on the host) |
| omit | API key if set + home dir if found |

With `apikey` auth the driver synthesizes `~/.qwen/settings.json`
inside the container: one openai-protocol provider entry whose id is
the swarmfile `model` (provider prefix stripped), key read from
`DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`, `security.auth.selectedType: openai` so no
interactive `/auth` is needed.  This is the CI-friendly path — no
login state to mount:

```json
{
  "driver": "qwen-cli",
  "agents": [{
    "model": "qwen3.8-max",
    "auth": "apikey",
    "base_url": "https://token-plan.ap-southeast-1.maas.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
  }]
}
```

Mind the region: ModelStudio keys are region-scoped, and qwen-code's
built-in default endpoint is China (cn-beijing).  International
accounts must set `base_url` (as above for a Token Plan key, or
`https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1` for a
standard pay-as-you-go key) or every request fails with
`401 Invalid API-key`.  Optional host-side override:
`QWEN_CONTEXT_WINDOW` (forwarded into the container; adds
`generationConfig.contextWindowSize` to the synthesized provider
entry — e.g. `1000000` for qwen3.8-max's 1M window).

For OAuth auth, configure `~/.qwen` on the host (run `qwen` and use
`/auth`, or `bl config agent --agent qwen-code` for Alibaba Cloud
ModelStudio), then set `"auth": "oauth"` in your swarm config.  The
home dir is bind-mounted read-only; each container copies it to a
writable location on startup.  Override the source path with
`QWEN_HOME=/path/to/qwen-home`.

### General rules

Groups with `api_key` or `auth_token` ignore the `auth`
field; their custom credential is always used.  When neither
is set, `auth` determines which host credential to inject.

The dashboard **Auth** column reflects the actual credential
source: `key`, `oauth`, `chatgpt`, `token`, or `auto` (see
Dashboard columns).

## Git coordination

Agents receive git rules (commit/push/rebase) via a system
prompt appendix. Your task prompt only needs to describe the
work.

Disable with `"inject_git_rules": false` in the swarmfile.

## Cost tracking

```bash
./costs.sh          # Table.
./costs.sh --json   # JSON.
```

Stats collected per session inside each container
(`agent_logs/stats_agent_*.tsv`), read on demand.

Dashboard columns:

- **Auth** — credential source: `key` (API key), `oauth`
  (Claude subscription token), `chatgpt` (ChatGPT subscription),
  `token` (Bearer / OpenRouter-style),
  `auto` (multiple credentials present, CLI decides).
- **Ctx** — context mode: `bare` (no `.claude/`), `slim`
  (only `CLAUDE.md`), or blank for full context.
- **Cost** — cumulative API cost in USD.
- **In/Out** — input and output tokens.
- **Cache** — prompt cache read tokens. Higher means the API
  is reusing cached context instead of reprocessing it,
  reducing cost and latency. Cache creation tokens (the
  one-time cost of populating the cache) are recorded in
  the TSV but not shown separately.
- **Turns** — number of assistant turns across all sessions.
- **Tok/s** — output tokens per second of API time.
- **Time** — cumulative wall-clock duration.

## Drivers

Agent drivers decouple the harness from any specific CLI tool.
Each driver (`lib/drivers/<name>.sh`) implements a fixed role
interface so the harness can run, monitor, and parse stats from
any supported agent.

Built-in drivers:

| Driver | CLI | Default |
|--------|-----|---------|
| `claude-code` | `claude` | Yes |
| `gemini-cli` | `gemini` | |
| `codex-cli` | `codex` | |
| `kimi-cli` | `kimi` | |
| `qwen-cli` | `qwen` | |
| `fake` | (none) | Test double for unit testing |

Set the driver globally in `swarm.json`:

```json
{ "driver": "claude-code" }
```

Or per agent group:

```json
{
  "agents": [
    { "count": 2, "model": "claude-opus-4-6" },
    { "count": 1, "model": "other-model", "driver": "other-driver" }
  ]
}
```

Per-agent drivers inherit the top-level `driver` field, which
defaults to `claude-code`.

### Pinning Claude Code version

By default the Docker image installs the latest Claude Code CLI.
To pin a specific version, set `claude_code_version` in the
swarmfile:

```json
{ "claude_code_version": "1.0.30" }
```

### Pinning Codex CLI version

By default the Docker image installs the latest Codex CLI.
To pin a specific version, set `codex_cli_version` in the
swarmfile:

```json
{ "codex_cli_version": "0.125.0" }
```

The value is forwarded to `npm install -g @openai/codex@<ver>`
inside the image build.  Leave the field unset (or empty) to
keep the default "latest published release" behavior.

### Pinning Kimi Code CLI version

By default the Docker image installs the latest Kimi Code CLI.
To pin a specific version, set `kimi_cli_version` in the
swarmfile:

```json
{ "kimi_cli_version": "0.28.0" }
```

The value is passed to the official install script
(`code.kimi.com/kimi-code/install.sh`) inside the image build.
Leave the field unset (or empty) to install the latest release.

### Pinning Qwen Code CLI version

By default the Docker image installs the latest Qwen Code CLI.
To pin a specific version, set `qwen_cli_version` in the
swarmfile:

```json
{ "qwen_cli_version": "0.21.5" }
```

The value is passed to the official standalone installer
(`install-qwen-standalone.sh`, no Node.js required) inside the
image build.  Leave the field unset (or empty) to install the
latest release.

### Writing a new driver

Create `lib/drivers/<name>.sh` implementing these functions:

```bash
agent_default_model()   # Fallback model when none configured
agent_name()            # Human-readable name for commit trailers
agent_cmd()             # CLI command name
agent_version()         # Print version string to stdout
agent_run()             # Run one session (model, prompt, logfile, append_file)
agent_interactive_run() # Start native UI (model, prompt_file, append_file)
agent_settings()        # Write agent config files into workspace
agent_extract_stats()   # Parse stats from log file (TSV output)
agent_detect_fatal()    # Detect fatal errors from log + exit code
agent_is_retriable()    # Detect retriable errors (rate limits, overload)
agent_activity_jq()     # Return jq filter for activity streaming
agent_docker_env()      # Print -e flags for agent-specific env vars
agent_docker_auth()     # Resolve credentials, emit Docker -e flags
agent_install_cmd()     # Print install commands (documentation only)
```

The Dockerfile hardcodes install steps for built-in drivers.
New drivers require corresponding Dockerfile changes.

See `lib/drivers/claude-code.sh` for the reference implementation
and `lib/drivers/fake.sh` for a minimal test double.

### Dry-run with the fake driver

Use the `fake` driver to validate setup scripts, prompt paths, and
config without spending tokens or requiring API keys.  Create a
swarmfile that sets `"driver": "fake"`:

```json
{
  "prompt": "your-prompt.md",
  "setup": "your-setup.sh",
  "driver": "fake",
  "agents": [
    { "count": 1, "model": "fake" }
  ]
}
```

Then run it:

```bash
SWARM_CONFIG=dry-run.json ./launch.sh start --dashboard
```

The fake driver runs the full harness loop — cloning, setup script
execution, git hooks — but replaces the agent session with a
synthetic JSONL stream that completes instantly.  This catches
path errors, missing dependencies, and config issues before any
real agent run.

Clean up afterwards:

```bash
PROJECT=$(basename $(pwd))
docker rm -f ${PROJECT}-agent-1 2>/dev/null
rm -rf "$XDG_STATE_HOME/claude-swarm/${PROJECT}"
```

## Cleanup

After a swarm run, the following artifacts remain on disk:

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| Bare repo | `<runtime>/upstream.git` |
| Submodule mirrors | `<runtime>/mirrors/*.git` |
| Agent containers | `<project>-agent-N` |
| State file | `<runtime>/swarm-state.json` |

The runtime is `$XDG_STATE_HOME/claude-swarm/<project>` by default
(`$HOME/.local/state/claude-swarm/<project>` when XDG is unset), or
`$CLAUDE_SWARM_RUNTIME_DIR` when overridden.

Remove everything for a fresh start:

```bash
PROJECT=$(basename $(pwd))
RUNTIME=${CLAUDE_SWARM_RUNTIME_DIR:-${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/claude-swarm/$PROJECT}
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq --filter "name=${PROJECT}-agent-") 2>/dev/null
rm -rf "$RUNTIME"
```

## Verify image

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint bash \
    -e "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
    $(basename $(pwd))-agent \
    -c 'claude --dangerously-skip-permissions \
        -p "What model are you? Reply with model id only." \
        --model claude-opus-4-6 2>&1'
```
