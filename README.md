# claude-swarm

[![CI](https://github.com/protocol-security/claude-swarm/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/protocol-security/claude-swarm/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

N coding agents in Docker, coordinating through git.
No orchestrator, no message passing.  Designed to support
multiple agent CLIs via a driver abstraction layer.

Based on the agent-team pattern from
[Building a C Compiler with Large Language Models](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler).

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- bash (5.0+), git, jq, bc
- tput (ncurses) — used by the dashboard
- An Anthropic API key, OAuth token, or compatible endpoint

For development: `shellcheck` for linting.

## Setup

Add as a submodule:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/protocol-security/claude-swarm.git tools/claude-swarm
```

Or clone standalone and run from your project directory
(with a `swarm.json` in the project root):

```bash
./path/to/claude-swarm/launch.sh start --dashboard
```

## How it works

```
Host                         private project runtime (0700)
~/project/ ── git clone ──>  upstream.git (rw)
               --bare        mirrors/ (ro)
target repo ── mirror ─────> target.git (ro, one resolved SHA)
                                        |
                                        | docker volumes
                                        |
                 .-----------.----------+-----------.
                 |           |          |           |
           Container 1            Container 2       ...
           /upstream  (rw)        /upstream  (rw)
           /mirrors   (ro)        /mirrors   (ro)
           /target-upstream (ro)  /target-upstream (ro)
                 |                      |
                 v                      v
           /workspace/            /workspace/
           (agent-work)           (agent-work)
```

All containers mount the same bare repo. Each runs
`lib/harness.sh` which loops: reset to `origin/agent-work`,
run one agent session, push. When one agent pushes, others
see the changes on the next fetch.

Interactive containers use the same image and setup, but start a
human-guided driver UI or shell on a separate
`swarm/<run>/interactive-*` branch. `harvest.sh` merges those
branches explicitly alongside `agent-work`.

Embedders should use `control.sh`, not internal script paths. Its
`claude-swarm.control/v1` JSON operations report capabilities, paths, and
containers; lifecycle operations delegate to the engine version that owns the
control file. Recursive submodules and their actual Git directories are
discovered at runtime, so moving a gitlink does not require an embedder patch.

The runtime defaults to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/claude-swarm/<project>` (or
`$HOME/.local/state/claude-swarm/<project>`), but an embedder can set an
absolute `CLAUDE_SWARM_RUNTIME_DIR` (the local dashboard uses persistent
per-slot state). Existing top-level `/tmp` state is migrated only after
same-owner, non-symlink, unlocked, collision-free validation.

## Quick start

```bash
# Create a swarmfile and launch numbered agents.
SWARM_CONFIG=swarm.json ./launch.sh start --dashboard

# Stable machine interface for an embedding tool.
./control.sh capabilities
./control.sh paths

# Later, after agents are running or have exited:
SWARM_CONFIG=swarm.json ./launch.sh wait

# Open a human-guided session from a named agent profile:
SWARM_CONFIG=swarm.json ./launch.sh interactive hunter

# Or place swarm.json in your repo root and launch.
./launch.sh start --dashboard
```

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for all commands, dashboard keys,
and testing.

## Configuration

Place a `swarm.json` in your repo root:

```json
{
  "prompt": "prompts/task.md",
  "setup": "scripts/setup.sh",
  "max_idle": 3,
  "driver": "claude-code",
  "agents": [
    { "count": 2, "model": "claude-opus-4-6", "effort": "high" },
    { "count": 1, "model": "claude-opus-4-6", "context": "none" },
    { "name": "reviewer", "count": 1, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6", "prompt": "prompts/review.md" },
    { "name": "hunter", "count": 0, "model": "gpt-5.4", "driver": "codex-cli" },
    {
      "count": 3,
      "model": "openrouter/custom",
      "base_url": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
      "api_key": "sk-or-..."
    }
  ],
  "post_process": {
    "prompt": "prompts/review.md",
    "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
    "max_idle": 2
  }
}
```

Groups without `api_key` use `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` from the environment. A named group
with omitted `count` or `count: 0` is useful as an
interactive-only profile.

**Per-group fields:** `name`, `model`, `count`, `effort`, `context`,
`prompt`, `auth`, `api_key`, `auth_token`, `base_url`, `tag`,
`driver`. See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for
field reference, environment variables, auth modes, context
modes, per-group prompts, and agent drivers.

## Drivers

Agent drivers decouple the harness from any specific CLI.
Each driver implements a fixed role interface:

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `agent_name` | Human-readable name (e.g. "Claude Code") |
| `agent_cmd` | CLI command (e.g. "claude") |
| `agent_version` | CLI version string |
| `agent_run` | Run one session, output JSONL |
| `agent_interactive_run` | Start the native interactive UI |
| `agent_settings` | Write agent-specific settings |
| `agent_extract_stats` | Parse session stats from log |
| `agent_detect_fatal` | Detect fatal errors from log + exit code |
| `agent_is_retriable` | Detect retriable errors (rate limits, overload) |
| `agent_activity_jq` | jq filter for activity display |

Built-in drivers: `claude-code` (default), `gemini-cli`,
`codex-cli`, `kimi-cli`, `qwen-cli`, `fake` (test double).  See
[USAGE.md](USAGE.md#writing-a-new-driver) for the full interface
and guide to writing a new driver.
