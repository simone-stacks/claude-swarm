Usage: $0

Container entrypoint for swarm agents. Not intended to be run
directly -- launched automatically inside Docker by launch.sh.

Clones the bare repo, runs optional setup, then loops agent
sessions until the agent is idle for MAX_IDLE cycles.

Required environment:
  SWARM_PROMPT   Path to prompt file (relative to repo root).

Optional environment:
  SWARM_MODEL    Model (default: driver's default model).
  AGENT_ID       Agent identifier (default: unnamed).
  SWARM_DRIVER   Agent driver (default: claude-code).
  SWARM_SETUP    Setup script to run before first session.
  MAX_IDLE       Idle sessions before exit (default: 3).
  MAX_RETRY_WAIT Max seconds to retry on fatal errors (default: 0 = no retry).
  INJECT_GIT_RULES  Inject git coordination rules (default: true).
  SWARM_CONTEXT  Context mode: full (default), slim, or none.

# Ship unpushed local commits via a scratch worktree.
#
# Fallback for when the in-place `git pull --rebase && git push`
# retry loop in the session-end push block has exhausted all three
# tries.  A scratch worktree doesn't need the main worktree to be
# clean -- it's a fresh detached checkout of origin/agent-work that
# we cherry-pick onto, then push from.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS:
#   Empirically (see CHANGELOG 0.20.5 for the full trace) the
#   in-place rebase path fails on real-world codex-cli swarms that
#   run against a superproject with submodules and context-stripping
#   git hooks: stash + submodule-sync put the tree clean, but by the
#   time the rebase's pre-apply check runs, something -- most likely
#   the post-checkout hook firing during the rebase's internal
#   checkouts under .git/rebase-merge/ -- has re-dirtied the tree.
#   The commits are already in .git/objects; we don't need the main
#   worktree at all to ship them upstream.
#
#   The agents themselves already use this pattern manually inside a
#   session (e.g. `git -C /tmp/agent1-rankpush-XYZ cherry-pick ...
#   && git push origin HEAD:agent-work`); hoisting the same dance
#   into the harness turns the retry loop's "fail 3 times and lose
#   the commits" terminal state into a "one more attempt via a
#   pristine checkout" rescue.
#
# WHY IT WORKS:
#   The scratch worktree is a fresh detached checkout of
#   origin/agent-work (after an explicit refetch), and hooks are
#   suppressed in it via core.hooksPath=/dev/null so the context-
#   stripping post-checkout hook cannot re-delete files the cherry-
#   pick is meant to bring back.  Each unpushed commit is applied
#   via `cherry-pick -n` (no-commit); if the apply produces no net
#   change against HEAD the commit is dropped silently (equivalent
#   to git 2.45's `cherry-pick --empty=drop`, done by hand so we
#   stay portable to the git 2.39 on Debian bookworm), otherwise
#   it's committed with the original author/message via
#   `git commit -C`.  That handles the "skipped previously applied
#   commit" case from bug report Pattern A.  Submodules are
#   intentionally not checked out in the scratch worktree -- the
#   push only cares about the superproject's gitlinks, and keeping
#   the worktree submodule-free sidesteps the submodule-drift
#   dirtiness that tripped Pattern C.
#
# Returns: 0 on successful push, 1 on any failure.

    # v0.20.2 tried to solve this with `rebase.autoStash=true`, but
    # autoStash has three documented gaps that caused real push
    # failures in production (see CHANGELOG 0.20.4 for the
    # failure-mode breakdown):
    #
    #   (1) `git stash` defaults to NOT stashing untracked files, so
    #       autoStash silently leaves `?? <path>` in the worktree and
    #       the rebase refuses anyway.
    #
    #   (2) `git stash` does NOT capture submodule pointer drift
    #       (`M <submodule>`) regardless of flags -- the superproject
    #       gitlink diff is simply not visible to stash's default
    #       traversal.  Agents that run `cargo build`, `git worktree
    #       add`, or anything else that bumps a submodule HEAD trip
    #       this every time.
    #
    #   (3) When autoStash does create a stash, the auto-pop after a
    #       successful rebase is best-effort per git's own docs and
    #       was observed failing mid-rebase on
    #       "skipped previously applied commit" in multi-agent swarms.
    #
    # The fix below sidesteps all three by doing the stash explicitly
    # (with --include-untracked), re-syncing submodule HEADs to what
    # the superproject expects, and running the rebase against a
    # guaranteed-clean tree.  We intentionally do NOT pop the stash:
    # the next loop iteration runs `git reset --hard origin/agent-work`
    # at the top, which would wipe a popped stash anyway, so popping
    # here buys nothing while reintroducing the autoStash-pop conflict
